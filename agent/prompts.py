# PROMPT FOR RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT
GRADE_PROMPT = """You are a classifier used to assess the relevance of a retrieved document compared to a user's question.
Here is the retrieved document: 

 {document} 

Here is the user's question: {question} 

If the document contains keywords related to the user's question, rate it as 'relevant'.
This does not need to be a very strict test. The goal is to filter out incorrect retrieval results.

Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question.
Provide the binary score as JSON with a single key 'binary_score' and no preamble or explanation."""

1. Is more specific and clear

3. Maintains the user's original intent
